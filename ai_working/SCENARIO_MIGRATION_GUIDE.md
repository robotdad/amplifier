# Scenario Migration Guide: Legacy to Amplifier-Dev

> **Purpose:** Migrate an existing scenario/app from legacy Amplifier to new amplifier-dev architecture
> **Audience:** Anyone migrating scenarios in a fresh session
> **Status:** Living document - add lessons learned after each migration

---

## Prerequisites: Study These First

Before migrating, understand the target architecture:

### Core Philosophy (30 minutes)
- `@amplifier-dev/docs/context/KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY.md` - Mechanism vs policy, tiny kernel
- `@amplifier-dev/docs/context/IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md` - Ruthless simplicity
- `@amplifier-dev/docs/context/MODULAR_DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` - Bricks and studs

### Architecture (20 minutes)
- `@amplifier-dev/docs/AMPLIFIER_AS_LINUX_KERNEL.md` - Linux kernel metaphor
- `@amplifier-dev/AMPLIFIER_CONTEXT_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference

### Module Development (15 minutes)
- `@amplifier-dev/MODULE_DEVELOPMENT_LESSONS.md` - Practical lessons from building modules
  - **Critical:** Lines 70-88 on git sources vs path dependencies
  - Lines 135-174 on capability registry pattern
  - Lines 177-192 on path handling

**Total study time:** ~1 hour to ground yourself in the new world

---

## Migration Process

### Step 0: Analyze the Existing Scenario

**Understand what you're migrating:**

1. **What problem does it solve?** (from README)
2. **What's the thinking process?** (the "metacognitive recipe" from HOW_TO_CREATE_YOUR_OWN.md if it exists)
3. **What stages/components exist?** (code structure)
4. **What dependencies does it have?** (imports, external libraries)
5. **What reusable patterns exist?** (state management, multi-stage pipeline)

**Document your findings:**
```
Problem: [What user need does this solve?]
Recipe: [The thinking process - step 1, step 2, etc.]
Stages: [List the components/stages]
Dependencies: [Old amplifier imports, external libs]
Patterns: [State management? Resume/interrupt? Multi-stage?]
```

---

### Step 1: Create New Repository

**Repository naming convention:**
```
amplifier-app-{purpose}
# Examples:
amplifier-app-blog-writer
amplifier-app-transcribe
amplifier-app-knowledge-synthesizer
```

**Initialize structure:**
```bash
mkdir amplifier-app-{name}
cd amplifier-app-{name}
git init

# Create basic structure
mkdir -p src/{app_name}
mkdir -p .amplifier/profiles
touch pyproject.toml
touch README.md
touch HOW_THIS_APP_WAS_MADE.md  # Recipe/thinking process doc
```

---

### Step 2: Setup Dependencies with Git Sources

**Critical pattern for shareable apps:**

Path dependencies only work within a specific directory structure.
Git sources work anywhere and enable frictionless sharing.

**Create `pyproject.toml`:**
```toml
[project]
name = "amplifier-app-{name}"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "{What this app does}"
dependencies = [
    "amplifier-core",
    # Add specific modules you need:
    # "amplifier-module-providers-anthropic",
    # "amplifier-app-cli",  # If building CLI
]

[tool.uv.sources]
# ✅ Use git sources, NOT path dependencies
amplifier-core = {
    git = "https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-dev",
    subdirectory = "amplifier-core",
    branch = "main"
}

# Add other modules with same pattern:
# amplifier-module-providers-anthropic = {
#     git = "https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-dev",
#     subdirectory = "amplifier-module-providers-anthropic",
#     branch = "main"
# }

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

**Why this matters:**
- Anyone can clone your app repo and run it
- No "you must put this next to that" instructions
- Dependencies download automatically
- Works with public or private repos (if user has auth)

---

### Step 3: Map Legacy Imports to New APIs

**Common legacy patterns → new amplifier-dev:**

```python
# Legacy import (old amplifier)
from amplifier.utils.logger import get_logger

# New import (amplifier-dev)
from amplifier_core.logging import get_logger  # Or wherever it actually is

# Pattern: Check amplifier-dev source to find new locations
# 1. Grep for the function/class name
# 2. Check module __init__.py files
# 3. Read module README.md for API docs
```

**Finding new APIs:**
```bash
# In amplifier-dev repo
cd amplifier-dev
grep -r "get_logger" --include="*.py"
# Follow the breadcrumbs to new location
```

**Document the mapping:**
```
Legacy → New
- amplifier.utils.logger → amplifier_core.logging
- amplifier.utils.state → [vendor your own or use module]
- [add mappings as you discover them]
```

---

### Step 4: Identify What to Include in Your App vs Use from Modules

**Decision framework:**

| Pattern | Decision | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **State management for your app** | Include in your app | App-specific, not reusable |
| **LLM retry/defensive patterns** | Check if module exists | Generic, potentially reusable |
| **Domain logic** (blog writing, transcription) | Include in your app | App-specific |
| **Generic utilities** (file I/O, path handling) | Check amplifier-dev | Might be in core/modules |

**Including in your app means copying the code into your project:**
```
src/your_app/
├── main.py           # Your app logic
├── state.py          # App-specific state management (you write this)
└── utils.py          # App-specific utilities (you write this)
```

**Using modules means importing from amplifier-dev:**
```python
# If a module provides what you need
from amplifier_module_workflow_state import StateManager  # If it exists
```

**When in doubt:** Include code in your app first, extract to amplifier-dev module later if pattern emerges across multiple apps.

**Note for advanced users:** If you recognize something that should be a module (generic, reusable across apps), you can build it as a module instead. But this is optional - most migrations should just include everything in the app for simplicity.

---

### Step 5: Handle Path Expansion

**Critical: Python's Path() doesn't expand `~` automatically:**

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Path() doesn't expand ~
Path("~/Source/data")

# ✅ CORRECT - Always expanduser()
Path("~/Source/data").expanduser()

# Apply to all config paths:
data_dir = Path(config.get("data_dir", "~/.data")).expanduser()
```

**Where to apply:**
- Any path from config files
- Any path from CLI arguments
- Any path from environment variables

---

### Step 6: Preserve the Metacognitive Recipe

**This is the soul of the app - don't lose it!**

Create `HOW_THIS_APP_WAS_MADE.md` in your new repo:

```markdown
# How This App Was Made

## The Problem
[What user need does this solve?]

## The Solution: A Metacognitive Recipe

This app embodies a structured thinking process:

1. **Stage 1:** [First, understand X...]
2. **Stage 2:** [Then, do Y based on what you learned...]
3. **Stage 3:** [Check if Z meets criteria...]
4. **Stage 4:** [Refine based on feedback...]

## Why This Recipe Works

[Explain the reasoning behind the stages]

## Code Structure Maps to Recipe

- Stage 1 → `src/stage1.py`
- Stage 2 → `src/stage2.py`
- etc.

## Lessons Learned Building This

[Migration notes]
[What worked well]
[What was tricky]
```

**This document shows:**
- How to think about the problem
- Why this structure makes sense
- How others can adapt the pattern

---

### Step 7: Create Profile for Sharing (if applicable)

**If you want others to use your app via amplifier CLI:**

The power of profiles with `source:` fields is that users can just drop your profile file into their `.amplifier/profiles/` directory and modules download automatically from git.

Create `.amplifier/profiles/{app-name}.md`:

```yaml
---
profile:
  name: {app-name}
  version: "1.0.0"

session:
  orchestrator:
    module: loop-basic
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-dev@main#subdirectory=amplifier-module-loop-basic
  context:
    module: context-simple

tools:
  - module: tool-bash
  - module: tool-filesystem
  - module: tool-{your-app}
    source: git+https://github.com/you/amplifier-app-{name}@main#subdirectory=src
    config:
      # Your app-specific config

providers:
  - module: provider-anthropic
---

# {App Name} Profile

## What This Profile Does

[Explanation]

## Quick Start

**Installation:**
```bash
# User just copies your profile file to their profiles directory
cp {app-name}.md ~/.amplifier/profiles/

# Modules download automatically when first used
amplifier run --profile {app-name} "task description"
```

## Configuration

[Any config options]
```

**Why this matters:**
- Users don't need to clone your repo
- They just need the profile file
- Modules download automatically via git sources
- Frictionless sharing

**Note:** Most scenario apps will be standalone CLIs, not profile-based.
Profiles are for when you want to leverage amplifier's orchestration.

---

### Step 8: Write Migration README

**Document what you did for future reference:**

**Note:** For migrated apps, `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` serves as your "creation story" - showing how you brought the app into the new amplifier-dev world. It's equivalent to `HOW_I_BUILT_THIS.md` for apps built from scratch.

Create `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` in your new repo:

```markdown
# Migration Notes: Legacy → Amplifier-Dev

## Original Scenario
- Source: [path or description]
- Date migrated: [date]

## Key Changes

### Dependencies
- Changed: [old imports] → [new imports]
- Added: [new modules]
- Removed: [deprecated dependencies]

### Architecture Changes
- [What structural changes you made]

### API Mappings
| Legacy | New |
|--------|-----|
| [old]  | [new] |

### Step 9: Verify and Test

**Checklist before considering migration complete:**

```bash
# Clean environment test
rm -rf .venv
uv sync
# Should install all dependencies from git sources

# Run the app
[your run command]

# Test core workflows
[test scenario 1]
[test scenario 2]

# Test path handling
# Try with ~ paths
# Try with relative paths
# Try with absolute paths

# Test state management (if applicable)
# Interrupt and resume
# Check checkpoint files

# Test error handling
# What happens on API failures?
# What happens on bad inputs?
```

---

## Common Patterns & Solutions

### Pattern: Multi-Stage Pipeline

**Legacy approach:**
```python
def run_pipeline():
    result1 = stage1()
    result2 = stage2(result1)
    result3 = stage3(result2)
    return result3
```

**New approach (with state management):**
```python
class Pipeline:
    def __init__(self, state_manager):
        self.state = state_manager

    async def run(self):
        stage = self.state.current_stage

        if stage == "initialized":
            await self.stage1()
            self.state.advance("stage1_complete")

        if stage == "stage1_complete":
            await self.stage2()
            self.state.advance("stage2_complete")

        # etc.
```

### Pattern: Retry & Defensive LLM Calls

**Check if amplifier-dev has utilities:**
```bash
grep -r "retry" amplifier-dev/ --include="*.py"
# Look for retry decorators or utilities
```

**If not, vendor your own:**
```python
async def retry_llm_call(func, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return await func()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
```

### Pattern: File I/O with Progress

**Keep user-facing progress logging:**
```python
from amplifier_core.logging import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)

def process_files(files):
    logger.info(f"Processing {len(files)} files...")
    for i, file in enumerate(files):
        logger.info(f"  [{i+1}/{len(files)}] {file.name}")
        # process
```

## Git Sources Deep Dive

**Why git sources matter:**

**Without git sources:**
```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
amplifier-core = { path = "../../amplifier-dev/amplifier-core" }
```
**Problem:** Only works if:
- You clone amplifier-dev
- You clone this app
- You put them in specific relative positions
- Everyone who uses your app must do the same

**With git sources:**
```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
amplifier-core = {
    git = "https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-dev",
    subdirectory = "amplifier-core"
}
```
**Benefit:**
- User clones your app repo
- Runs `uv sync`
- Dependencies download automatically from git
- Works anywhere, no directory coordination

**For private repos:**
- User needs GitHub auth (`gh auth login`)
- Still works fine, just requires auth
- Enables sharing without making repos public

## Lessons Learned Section

> **Note:** After each migration, add lessons here. This section grows over time.

### Migration 1: Transcribe - 2025-10-22

**Migration Type:** Tool Extraction + Standalone App

**What we did:**
- Extracted `tool-whisper` (OpenAI Whisper integration) as reusable tool
- Extracted `tool-youtube-dl` (YouTube download + metadata) as reusable tool
- Created `amplifier-app-transcribe` as standalone app with Rich CLI
- Used Tools-First Sequential approach (extract tools, then build app)

**What worked:**
- Clean module boundaries already existed in original code
- Tools-first approach validated APIs before app complexity
- Git sources in amplifier-dev monorepo (subdirectory pattern)
- Rich library for beautiful CLI output
- uvx distribution for frictionless user experience

**What was tricky:**
- Deciding tool vs app boundaries (Whisper reusable, formatting app-specific)
- Understanding amplifier-dev module patterns (entry points, events, protocols)
- Git source syntax for subdirectories in same repo

**Key decisions:**
- Two separate tools (not one combined) - maintains single responsibility
- Stateless tools, stateful app - clear separation of concerns
- CLI first, web interface later - MVP approach
- Standard Microsoft boilerplate files in all modules

**API mappings discovered:**
- Legacy: `from amplifier.utils.logger import get_logger`
- New: `from amplifier_core.logging import get_logger` (verify actual location)
- Legacy: `from amplifier.ccsdk_toolkit.defensive import *`
- New: Keep in app for now (app-specific utilities)

**Reusable patterns identified:**
- State management for batch processing (checkpoint/resume)
- Defensive file I/O with retry (OneDrive compatibility)
- Multi-stage pipeline orchestration
- Cost estimation before API calls

**Files created:**
- `ai_working/ddd/plan.md` - Complete migration specification
- `ai_working/ddd/templates/*/` - Documentation templates for 3 modules
- `scenarios/transcribe/MIGRATION_NOTICE.md` - User-facing migration info

**Philosophy alignment:**
- ✅ Ruthless simplicity: Extract only reusable parts
- ✅ Modular design: Clean tool boundaries
- ✅ Tools-first: Generic capabilities before workflows
- ✅ Bricks & studs: Stable interfaces, regeneratable modules

**Recommendations for future migrations:**
1. Analyze existing code structure first - good modules may already exist
2. Use Tools-First approach when clear reusable capabilities identified
3. App-First acceptable for tightly coupled scenarios
4. Document tool APIs before building app
5. Test tools independently before integration
