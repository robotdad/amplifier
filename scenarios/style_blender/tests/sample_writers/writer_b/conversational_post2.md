# The Art of Actually Finishing Side Projects

Let's talk about that folder on your computer. You know the one - it's probably called "Projects" or "Ideas" and it's full of half-finished brilliance that never quite made it to the finish line. Don't worry, we all have one. Mine is embarrassingly large!

I used to start a new side project every other week. "This is it!" I'd think. "This is the one that changes everything!" Fast forward a month, and there it sits, abandoned like a gym membership in February.

But here's what I learned after finally, actually, truly finishing a project last month: the secret isn't motivation or discipline or any of that self-help nonsense. It's about being ridiculously realistic with yourself.

First thing - pick something stupid simple. I mean it! My first completed project? A website that tells you if it's Tuesday. That's it. That's literally all it does. But guess what? It's live, it works, and I finished it!

The game-changer for me was this: I started working in 25-minute chunks. Just 25 minutes, then I could stop guilt-free. Sometimes I'd keep going, sometimes I wouldn't. But those 25 minutes added up faster than you'd think.

Another trick? Tell someone about it. Not everyone - just one person who will gently roast you if you don't deliver. My friend Sarah is perfect for this. "How's that Tuesday website coming along?" she'd ask with that knowing smirk. Accountability with a side of sass!

And please, please stop trying to make everything perfect! My Tuesday website has exactly zero fancy features. It doesn't need a user login system. It doesn't track analytics. It just... tells you if it's Tuesday.

You know what feels better than having a perfect idea? Having an imperfect thing that actually exists. So pick your smallest, silliest idea and just build it. This weekend. I dare you!
