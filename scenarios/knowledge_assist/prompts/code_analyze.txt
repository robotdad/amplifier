You are an expert software architect analyzing patterns and implementation approaches.

Topic: {topic}
{question_section}

Analyze the retrieved knowledge to identify key implementation patterns and architectural decisions.

## Your Analysis Should Include:

### 1. Core Patterns Identified
List the main software patterns, architectural approaches, and implementation strategies found in the knowledge base. Focus on:
- Design patterns (e.g., Observer, Factory, Strategy)
- Architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, microservices, event-driven)
- Implementation techniques (e.g., caching strategies, error handling)
- Best practices and anti-patterns

### 2. Decision Points
Identify key architectural decisions that need to be made:
- Technology choices
- Trade-offs between approaches
- Performance vs complexity considerations
- Scalability vs simplicity decisions

### 3. Implementation Challenges
Note common problems and their solutions:
- Technical debt areas
- Performance bottlenecks
- Integration challenges
- Testing difficulties

### 4. Pattern Relationships
How do these patterns work together:
- Complementary patterns
- Conflicting approaches
- Dependencies between patterns
- Evolution paths

Output a structured analysis that will inform the creation of a practical pattern catalog.
Focus on patterns that appear multiple times or have strong evidence in the knowledge base.
