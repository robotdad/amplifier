# Ideas for Blog Post on AI Development

Need to write about the new approach to AI-driven development. Main points:

- AI is changing how we write code - not just autocomplete but full module generation
- The "bricks and studs" philosophy - modular components that snap together
- Humans become architects not coders - define specs, AI builds
- Can generate multiple solutions in parallel - try different approaches simultaneously
- State management is critical for interruption/resume
- Need defensive programming for LLM outputs

Key insight: We're moving from editing code line by line to describing what we want and having AI generate complete modules. This is like having construction bricks that can assemble themselves.

Important to mention:
- Each module is self-contained
- Clear contracts between modules
- Can regenerate any module without breaking others
- Testing at the behavior level not implementation

This fundamentally changes the developer role - more design and validation, less coding.
