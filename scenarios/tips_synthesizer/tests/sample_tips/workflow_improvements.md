# Workflow Improvements

## Automation

### Automate Repetitive Tasks
If you do something more than twice, automate it. Write a script, create an alias, or use a tool like Make:
```bash
# Instead of typing long commands repeatedly
alias gcp='git add . && git commit -m "WIP" && git push'
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Learn and customize keyboard shortcuts for your most common actions. The time saved adds up quickly:
- IDE: Code formatting, refactoring, navigation
- OS: Window management, app switching
- Browser: Tab management, developer tools

## Development Environment

### Dotfiles Management
Keep your configuration files (`.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, etc.) in a Git repository. This makes setting up new machines instant and keeps configurations synchronized.

### Project Templates
Create templates for common project types. Include standard structure, configuration files, and boilerplate code:
```bash
cookiecutter python-project-template/
```

## Code Quality

### Pre-commit Hooks
Set up pre-commit hooks to catch issues before they enter the repository:
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
```

### Continuous Integration
Even for personal projects, set up CI to run tests automatically. GitHub Actions is free for public repositories:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: make test
```

## Communication

### Clear Commit Messages
Write commit messages that explain why, not just what:
```
Bad: "Fixed bug"
Good: "Fix race condition in user session cleanup

The session cleanup worker was not acquiring a lock before
deletion, causing occasional data corruption when users
logged out during peak traffic."
```

### Documentation as You Go
Write documentation while the context is fresh in your mind. Future you will thank present you:
- Add docstrings immediately after writing functions
- Update README when adding features
- Document "why" decisions in code comments

## Learning and Growth

### Learning in Public
Share what you learn through blog posts, tweets, or internal wikis. Teaching reinforces learning and helps others.

### Code Reviews as Learning
Treat code reviews as learning opportunities:
- Ask questions about unfamiliar patterns
- Explain your reasoning for reviewers
- Save useful review comments for future reference

### Side Project Friday
Dedicate Friday afternoons to learning new technologies through small projects. This keeps skills sharp and makes work more enjoyable.
