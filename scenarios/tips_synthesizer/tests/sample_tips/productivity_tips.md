# Productivity Tips

## Time Management

### The Two-Minute Rule
If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately rather than adding it to your to-do list. This prevents small tasks from accumulating and becoming overwhelming.

### Time Blocking
Instead of working from a to-do list, block specific time periods in your calendar for specific types of work. For example, 9-11am for deep work, 11-12pm for emails, etc.

## Focus Techniques

### The Pomodoro Technique
Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After 4 pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break. This helps maintain focus and prevents burnout.

### Single-Tasking
Despite the myth of multitasking, focusing on one task at a time actually increases productivity. Close unnecessary tabs, silence notifications, and give your full attention to one task.

## Energy Management

### Match Tasks to Energy Levels
Schedule your most important or challenging work during your peak energy hours. Save routine tasks for when your energy is lower.

### Take Real Breaks
Step away from your desk during breaks. Walk around, stretch, or do something completely different. Your brain needs actual rest to maintain productivity.

## Organization

### Weekly Reviews
Every week, spend 30 minutes reviewing what you accomplished, what didn't get done, and planning the upcoming week. This keeps you aligned with your goals.

### The One-Touch Rule
When you pick up a document or open an email, deal with it immediately: file it, delete it, or act on it. Don't just move it to another pile.
